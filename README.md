# Open Source Ag Forecasting API

This API provides access to weather-related data using a FastAPI-based backend. The application integrates weather station data and forecasting from multiple sources, including IBM Weather and Wisconet. It also supports querying bulk measurements for stations over specified date ranges.

## Features

- Station Fields Retrieval: Get details of a weather station by its ID.
- Bulk Measurements: Retrieve weather measurements for a station within a specified date range and frequency.
- Active Stations Query: List stations based on active days and a provided start date.
- IBM Weather Integration: Fetch and clean daily weather data from IBM Weather API.
- Wisconet Weather Data: Access weather data aggregated daily from Wisconet.



## Agriculture models: ag_models_wrappers folder
The ag_models_wrappers serve as the critical layer for providing crop model-based risk assessments tailored to weather data on specific locations eg Wisconet Stations or punctual locations in Wisconsin by IBM data. This component integrates various forecasting models to deliver localized risk predictions for plant diseases for a given forecasting date, enabling informed decision-making in agricultural management.
- Wisconet API Wrapper: This REST API simplifies communication between the Wisconet API service and our dashboard. We developed an API that dynamically retrieves data from available weather stations, fetching daily and hourly variables necessary for the input of various disease models.
- IBM API Wrapper: This REST API facilitates communication between the IBM paid service and our dashboard. Access to the IBM service is secured with an API key.
Both APIs are open-source and can be integrated into other processes. Note that the IBM API requires an API key for access.
See below the documentation.

## Installation

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/ag_forecasting_api.git
cd pywisconet

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running the API
```commandline
uvicorn main:app --reload

```
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Endpoints

### Get Station Fields
Endpoint: /station_fields/{station_id}
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves the fields associated with the specified station.
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /station_fields/12345

```

### Bulk Measurements
Endpoint: /bulk_measures/{station_id}
Method: GET
Query Parameters:

- start_date: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-07-01) assumed to be in Central Time (CT).
- end_date: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-07-02) assumed to be in CT.
- measurements: Measurement types (e.g., AIRTEMP, DEW_POINT, WIND_SPEED, RELATIVE_HUMIDITY, or ALL for the last four).
- frequency: Frequency of measurements (e.g., MIN60, MIN5, DAILY).
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /bulk_measures/12345?start_date=2024-07-01&end_date=2024-07-02&measurements=AIRTEMP&frequency=MIN60

```
### Active Stations
Endpoint: /wisconet/active_stations/
Method: GET
Query Parameters:

min_days_active: Minimum number of days a station should have been active.
start_date: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /wisconet/active_stations/?min_days_active=10&start_date=2024-07-01

```

### IBM Weather Data
Endpoint: /ag_models_wrappers/ibm
Method: GET
Path Parameter:

- forecasting_date: Date for the forecast in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Query Parameters:
- latitude: Latitude of the location.
- longitude: Longitude of the location.
- API_KEY: IBM API key.
- TENANT_ID: Tenant ID.
- ORG_ID: Organization ID.
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /ag_models_wrappers/ibm?forecasting_date=2024-07-01&latitude=41.8781&longitude=-87.6298&API_KEY=your_key&TENANT_ID=your_tenant&ORG_ID=your_org

```

### Wisconet Weather Data
Endpoint: /ag_models_wrappers/wisconet
Method: GET
Query Parameters:

- forecasting_date: Date for the forecast in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- risk_days: (Optional) Number of risk days (default is 1).
- station_id: (Optional) Station ID for filtering the results.
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /ag_models_wrappers/wisconet?forecasting_date=2024-07-01&risk_days=1&station_id=12345

```

**See more examples in the** notebooks/examples.ipynb

## Root Endpoint
Endpoint: /
Method: GET
Description: A simple welcome message to indicate that the API is up and running.
Usage Example:
```commandline
GET /
```

## WSGI Compatibility

This API includes a WSGI application wrapped with Starletteâ€™s WSGIMiddleware for compatibility with WSGI servers. The create_wsgi_app function creates a WSGI application that delegates HTTP requests to the FastAPI app. This can be useful when integrating with legacy systems or deploying in environments that require a WSGI interface.

### Environment Variables

For the IBM Weather data endpoint to work properly, ensure that you set the following environment variables in your deployment environment:

- IBM_API_KEY
- TENANT_ID
- ORG_ID
These credentials are validated against the values provided in the query parameters.

## pywisconet
We provide also an API wrapper that represents an interface for interacting with Wisconet v1 data. The intended objective is to provide a streamlined method for accessing weather and environmental data from Wisconet's network of stations, enabling users to integrate this data into their own applications and forecasting models for agricultural and environmental analysis.
